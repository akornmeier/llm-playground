Meridian Health Systems, Inc.", "court": "United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit", "date_filed": "2024-03-15", "text": "Before the Court is the appeal of plaintiff James Henderson from the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Meridian Health Systems, Inc. Henderson alleges that Meridian violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by terminating his employment after he disclosed his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The district court concluded that Henderson failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because he could not demonstrate that he was qualified to perform the essential functions of his position with or without reasonable accommodation.\n\nWe review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, construing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). Under the ADA, a plaintiff must show that (1) he is disabled within the meaning of the Act, (2) he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation, and (3) he suffered an adverse employment action because of his disability. Hoffman v. Caterpillar, Inc., 256 F.3d 568, 572 (7th Cir. 2001).\n\nUpon careful review of the record, we find that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether Henderson could perform the essential functions of his position as a regional sales manager with the accommodation of a modified travel schedule. The district court erred in accepting Meridian's characterization of weekly overnight travel as an essential function without examining whether other regional managers operated under similar requirements. We therefore REVERSE the grant of summary judgment and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.", "citations": ["Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986)", "Hoffman v.

The State contends that Pacific Coast's operations have resulted in the discharge of pollutants, including benzene and toluene, into waters of the United States without the required National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits.\n\nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).

The Commission found that Westbrook failed to disclose material conflicts of interest arising from its practice of allocating initial public offering shares to proprietary accounts before satisfying client orders, and that it lacked adequate compliance policies and procedures to prevent such preferential treatment.\n\nOur review of Commission sanctions is governed by a deferential standard. We will uphold the Commission's findings of fact if supported by substantial evidence, and we will defer to the Commission's choice of sanction unless it is unwarranted in law or without justification in fact. Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1137 (5th Cir. 1979), aff'd, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). The Commission possesses broad discretion in selecting sanctions that are necessary to protect the investing public. Barkate v. SEC, 123 F. App'x 209, 212 (5th Cir. 2005).\n\nWestbrook argues that the Commission's order revoking its investment adviser registration was disproportionate given that no client suffered actual financial loss. We disagree. The Commission reasonably concluded that Westbrook's systematic prioritization of proprietary trading over client interests, combined with affirmative misrepresentations in its Form ADV disclosures, demonstrated a pattern of conduct fundamentally incompatible with the fiduciary duties owed by investment advisers.

Thompson contends that the Board's evaluation team failed to consider private neuropsychological testing demonstrating that D.T. exhibits a significant discrepancy between her cognitive ability and academic achievement in the areas of reading fluency and written expression.\n\nUnder the IDEA, a reviewing court applies a modified de novo standard, giving due weight to the determinations of the administrative hearing officer while independently evaluating the evidence. Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1982). The party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of persuasion. Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 62 (2005). In assessing eligibility, the question is not merely whether the child has a disability, but whether that disability adversely affects educational performance such that the child requires specially designed instruction.\n\nThe Court finds that the Board's evaluation team committed a procedural violation by failing to consider the independent neuropsychological evaluation submitted by Thompson, as required by 34 C.F.R. section 300.502(c). Furthermore, the record demonstrates that D.T.'s standardized test scores in reading fluency fell at the 8th percentile despite cognitive ability scores at the 75th percentile, which the hearing officer failed to adequately address.

Plaintiff Nakamura Technologies, Inc. asserts claims for patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. section 271, alleging that Quantum Dynamics' QD-5000 series semiconductor fabrication equipment infringes claims 1, 4, 7, and 12 of U.S. Patent No. 11,234,567 (the '567 patent), which covers a method for atomic layer deposition using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition with a novel precursor delivery system.\n\nTo survive a motion to dismiss in a patent infringement action, a plaintiff must allege facts that, taken as true, plausibly establish both ownership of a valid patent and infringement by the defendant.
