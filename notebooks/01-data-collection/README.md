# Module 01: Data Collection

Explore Common Crawl's WARC files, extract a small corpus of legal text, and compare against curated sources like CourtListener's API. Learners see firsthand how noisy raw web data is versus purpose-scraped legal text. By the end of this module, you will have built a small but representative legal text corpus from both raw web sources and structured APIs, giving you practical experience with the trade-offs between broad crawl data and domain-specific datasets.

**Prerequisites:** None.
