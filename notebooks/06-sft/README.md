# Module 06: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Start with a small base model. Build an instruction dataset from legal Q&A pairs. Walk through the SFT training loop step by step. By the end of this module, you will have fine-tuned a language model on domain-specific instruction data, understanding every component of the training loop from data formatting to loss computation to checkpoint management.

**Prerequisites:** Modules 03, 04.
