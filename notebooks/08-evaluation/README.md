# Module 08: Evaluation

Apply traditional metrics and build a small evaluation harness. Introduce LLM-as-judge patterns. By the end of this module, you will have built a lightweight evaluation framework that combines automated metrics with LLM-based judging, giving you practical tools to measure model quality beyond simple loss numbers.

**Prerequisites:** Module 06.
