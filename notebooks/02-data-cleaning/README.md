# Module 02: Data Cleaning

Take raw corpus and apply quality filtering inspired by RefinedWeb and FineWeb pipelines — deduplication (MinHash), language filtering, content extraction, PII removal. Output a clean dataset. By the end of this module, you will have built a reproducible data cleaning pipeline that transforms noisy raw text into a high-quality, deduplicated, PII-scrubbed dataset ready for tokenization and model training.

**Prerequisites:** Module 01 (or use provided sample data).
