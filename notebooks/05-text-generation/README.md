# Module 05: Text Generation

Load a small pre-trained model and implement generation strategies from scratch: greedy, beam search, top-k, top-p, temperature scaling. Compare outputs on legal prompts. By the end of this module, you will have implemented every major decoding strategy by hand, understand the trade-offs each one makes between diversity and quality, and see how they perform on domain-specific legal text.

**Prerequisites:** Module 04.
