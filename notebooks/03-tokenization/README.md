# Module 03: Tokenization

Implement BPE from scratch in ~50 lines, then compare against HuggingFace's tokenizers library. Visualize how legal terminology tokenizes differently across vocabularies. Train a custom tokenizer on the legal corpus. By the end of this module, you will understand subword tokenization deeply, have a working BPE implementation, and possess a custom tokenizer trained on domain-specific legal text.

**Prerequisites:** None.
